# Analyzing Bank Loan Performance and Risk Assessment

## Overview
Financial institutions depend on loans as a major source of revenue. However, effective loan performance management is essential for minimizing risk and maximizing returns. This project focuses on analyzing key metrics related to loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower financial health. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to enhance decision-making, optimize loan approval strategies, and mitigate risk.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Evaluating loan portfolio performance to identify trends and patterns.
- Assessing borrower risk based on key financial indicators.
- Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios.
- Classifying loans as "Good" or "Bad" based on repayment behavior and performance metrics.
- Monitoring Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in loan performance.

## Key Performance Areas
### 1. Loan Portfolio Analysis
- Tracking total loan applications, approvals, and disbursements.
- Analyzing monthly and regional trends in lending activities.
- Assessing the impact of loan terms and borrower employment length on approvals and repayments.

### 2. Financial Performance Metrics
- Evaluating total funded amounts and repayments.
- Analyzing Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in funding and collections.
- Monitoring trends in average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios.

### 3. Loan Risk Assessment
- Identifying "Good" vs. "Bad" loans based on repayment behavior.
- Categorizing loan performance by loan status.
- Assessing the impact of home ownership on loan approvals and repayment rates.

## Conclusion
By analyzing these key metrics, we aim to optimize the lending process, enhance financial stability, and support informed decision-making for future loan disbursements.
