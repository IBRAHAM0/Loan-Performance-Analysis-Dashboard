Problem Statement: Analyzing Bank Loan Performance and Risk Assessment

A) Brief Introduction
		- Financial institutions rely on loans as a primary source of revenue, but effectively managing loan performance is critical to minimizing risk and maximizing returns. 
		- This project focuses on analyzing key metrics related to loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower financial health. 
		- By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to enhance decision-making, optimize loan approval strategies, and mitigate risk.

B) Objective
		- The goal of this analysis is to evaluate loan portfolio performance, identify trends, and assess borrower risk. 
		- We will track key performance indicators (KPIs), including  total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. 
		- Additionally, we will categorize loans as "Good" or "Bad" based on  	performance metrics and monitor Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

Key Performance Areas

	1. Loan Portfolio Analysis:

		- Total loan applications, approvals, and disbursements
		- Monthly and regional trends in lending activities
		- Loan term and borrower employment length impact

	2. Financial Performance Metrics:

		- Total funded amounts and repayments
		- MTD and MoM variations in funding and collections
		- Average interest rates and debt-to-income ratio trends
		
	3. Loan Risk Assessment:

		- Identification of Good vs. Bad loans based on repayment behavior
		- Breakdown of loan performance by loan status categories
		- Home ownership impact on loan approval and repayment rates
		

By analyzing these KPIs, we aim to optimize the lending process, improve financial stability, and drive informed decision-making for future loan disbursements.
